# Real-Time Signal Processing MATLAB App

## Overview

This MATLAB App is designed for real-time signal processing with options for applying highpass, lowpass, or bandpass filters. Users can interactively input the cutoff frequency and observe visualizations of both the raw and filtered signals, along with their corresponding frequency spectra.

## Features

- **Filter Types:** Choose from highpass, lowpass, or bandpass filters.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Observe real-time updates of raw and filtered signals in the time domain.
- **Frequency Spectrum:** Visualize the frequency spectra of both raw and filtered signals.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2019a or later.
- App Designer Toolbox.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Ahmed2793/Digital-stethoscope.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Launch the MATLAB App:**
   ```matlab
   app1
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the MATLAB App:**
   - Launch MATLAB and open the App Designer.
   - Open the `app1` app.

2. **Configure Signal Processing:**
   - Choose the desired filter type (highpass, lowpass).
   - Input the cutoff frequency.

3. **Initiate Data Acquisition:**
   - Click the "Start/Stop" button to begin or stop real-time data acquisition.

4. **Visualize Signals:**
   - Observe the real-time updates of both raw and filtered signals in the provided axes.
